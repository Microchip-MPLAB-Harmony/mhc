MPLAB Harmony v3 Configurator (MHC) is a free, graphical programming environment that generates seamless, 
easy-to-understand C code to be inserted into your project. The intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)  simplifies device setup, library selection and configuration, and application development
The MHC is available as a plugin that directly integrates with the MPLAB® X IDE and as a separate Java executable for standalone use with other development environments.

The configurator provides convenient and powerful development tools for choosing library components from downloaded packages and configuring them for the developer’s application.  
The built-in code generator produces library and application starter code (usually in source form), based on the options chosen by the developer.
